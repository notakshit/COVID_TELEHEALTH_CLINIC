COVID really challenged us to make sure that our virtual health solutions could have the same kind of equitable reach as our in-person care, so that meant connecting with people who focus on medical interpretation to make sure we could provide medical interpreters to patients through the same channel. It also meant making sure that we thought about systems to engage our patients both into our electronic health record as the primary gateway to doing virtual visits, but also to think about the patients who for whatever reason were unable or reluctant to use that channel and provide alternative channels to connect those patients to their physicians. In the second wave of Covid, the healthcare system was so much burdened with the infected patients that the people who were facing Post Covid symptoms were unable to find doctors who can help them or provide them with consultations. 

This portal specifically focuses upon such people, who are facing issues with Post-Covid Symptoms like Difficulty thinking or concentrating (sometimes referred to as “brain fog”), 
Headache, Loss of smell or taste, Dizziness on standing, Fast-beating or pounding heart (also known as heart palpitations), Chest pain, Difficulty breathing, Depression or anxiety etc.
